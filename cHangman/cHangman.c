/* ***********************************************************************************************
 * cHangman.c - cHangman is a classic word guessing game that's both fun and educational. Here’s
 * how it works: The game picks a word from a list, but doesn’t reveal it. Instead, it shows a
 * series of blank spaces, each representing a letter in the word. Your goal is to guess the word
 * by suggesting letters, one at a time.
 *
 * If you guess a letter that's in the word, the game fills in all the blanks where that letter
 * appears. If you guess a letter that's not in the word, you lose an attempt. You only have a
 * limited number of incorrect guesses, so each wrong guess brings you closer to losing the game.
 *
 * The game continues until you've either guessed the word correctly or used up all your attempts.
 * If you manage to guess the word before your attempts run out, you win! But if you run out of
 * guesses, the game ends, and the hidden word is revealed.
 *
 * It's a fun challenge that tests your vocabulary and spelling skills, all while keeping you on
 * your toes with each guess.
 *
 * Compile instructions:
 * gcc/clang cHangman.c ../mylibs/cVersion.c ../mylibs/cManPage.c -o cHangman
 * pmake cHangman.makefile
