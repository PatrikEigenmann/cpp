/* ***********************************************************************************************
 * cEnigma.c - This c console application is a very simplified emulation of the Enigma decypher
 * device used by the Nazis in World War II. The Enigma decypher machine was developed and used in
 * the early to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. It
 * was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, across all branches of the German
 * military. The machine was considered so secure that it was used to encipher the most top-secret
 * messages.
 *
 * The Enigma machine has an electromechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters of the
 * alphabet. In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma’s keyboard and another person
 * writes down which of the 26 lights above the keyboard illuminated at each key press. If plain
 * text is entered, the illuminated letters are the ciphertext. Entering ciphertext transforms it
 * back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the
 * keys and the lights with each keypress.
 *
 * The security of the system depends on machine settings that were generally changed daily, based
 * on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that were changed for each
 * message. The receiving station would have to know and use the exact settings employed by the
 * transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.
 *
 * While the Enigma machine was complex and provided a high level of security, it was not
 * unbreakable. The code was first broken by the Poles, under the leadership of mathematician
 * Marian Rejewski, in the early 1930s2. Later, during the war, the British set up a secret
 * code-breaking group known as Ultra, under mathematician Alan M. Turing. The intelligence gained
 * from decrypting Enigma-enciphered messages contributed significantly to the Allied victories in
 * WWII.
 *
 * In this version of the program, the first command line argument is used to determine whether
 * to encode or decode the input file. The second argument is the base name of the input and
 * output files. If the operation is encoding, the program reads from a .txt file and writes to
 * a .enc file. If the operation is decoding, the program reads from a .enc file and writes to
 * a .txt file.
 *
 * Compile instructions:
 * gcc/clang cEnigma.c ../mylibs/cVersion.c ../mylibs/cManPage.c -o cEnigma
 * pmake cEnigma.makefile

 * rotate - Rotate the rotors by one position. The rotors, also known as cipher wheels, are a
 * crucial part of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used extensively during World War II1.
 *
 * Each Enigma machine came with a set of rotors that could be interchanged. The rotors had 26
 * contacts on one side and 26 pins on the other. When placed into the machine on a shaft, the
 * pins of one rotor connected to the contacts of the next.
 *
 * The rotors were responsible for scrambling the 26 letters of the alphabet. Each rotor was wired
 * differently, meaning each rotor contained a different cipher3. The wartime Enigma machines
 * could choose from a stock of five rotors, and any three could be used in any order.
 *
 * The position of each rotor, the ring setting, and its internal wiring all played a role in how
 * the machine encrypted messages. As the rotors rotated, the electrical connections between the
 * keys and the lights changed with each keypress. This rotation and the resulting changes in
 * connections created a vast number of possible scramblings, making the Enigma machine a powerful
 * tool for encryption.
 *

 * encode - The encode function is a key element in simulating the Enigma machine’s encryption
 * process. It takes an input character and a rotor configuration, and encodes the character based
 * on the rotor’s settings. This function simplifies the complex mechanism of the Enigma machine
 * into a digestible piece of code. If the character is an alphabetic letter, it’s transformed
 * using the rotor configuration. Non-alphabetic characters are returned as is. This function is a
 * testament to the power of programming in simulating real-world processes, providing a glimpse
 * into the workings of one of history’s most famous encryption devices.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * decode - The decode function is the counterpart to the encode function, reversing the encoding
 * process. It takes an input character and a rotor configuration, and if the character is an
 * alphabetic letter, it finds the original character before it was encoded by the rotor. This is
 * done by searching through the rotor until it finds the encoded character, then returns the
 * character that corresponds to that position in the alphabet. If the character is not an alphabetic
 * letter, it is returned as is. This function is another key piece in simulating the Enigma
 * machine’s process, turning encoded messages back into their original form.
