/* **********************************************************************************************************
 * cBreak.c - In C programming, the break keyword is a crucial control statement used to alter the flow of
 * loops and switch statements. Its primary function is to terminate the execution of the closest enclosing
 * loop or switch statement, allowing the program to exit the loop or switch immediately and continue with
 * the next statement after the loop or switch.
 *
 * For instance, consider a scenario where youâ€™re iterating over a list of items, and you want to stop the
 * iteration as soon as you find a particular item. The break statement becomes invaluable here, as it prevents
 * unnecessary iterations once the condition is met.
 *
 * compiler instructions:
 * clang/gcc cBreak.c -o cBreak
 * pmake cBreak.makefile

 * main - In the vast, uncharted realms of cyberspace, there exists a function. Not just any function, but
 * the main function. It is the gatekeeper, the sentinel that stands at the threshold of every C and C++
 * program. It is the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega.
 *
 * @param int argc     - Command argument count
 * @param char **argv  - Command argument strings
 * @return             - 0 if the program executes successfully. If the program encounters an error that
 *                       warrants termination, you can return a different integer value (commonly 1 or
 *                       another non-zero value) to indicate the type of error.
