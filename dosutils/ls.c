 * The intuitive flag system enables seamless command combinations such as -al, ensuring users get exactly the
 * information they need with minimal effort. Additionally, our user-friendly help feature, accessible via -?,
 * guides you through the command’s capabilities, mirroring the familiarity and ease of Unix man pages.
 *
 * Engineered to be both powerful and accessible, this utility empowers users to manage and explore their file
 * systems with newfound ease. Say goodbye to the cumbersome default dir command—welcome to a sleek, modern,
 * and highly functional directory listing tool. Ready to elevate your command-line experience? Dive into
 * productivity with our refined ls utility.
