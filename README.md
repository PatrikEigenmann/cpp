# cpp Projects

This repository contains C-based projects, utilities, and libraries, organized for easy navigation and use. The custom tool pmake is included to compile all projects and programs with its specific makefiles.
It is up to the developer completely to use my pmake, make or cmake. Whatever you prefer, but once you look into pmake and the ease of use, I promise you'll love it. :-)

### 4. **mylibs**
This folder contains shared libraries, umbrella headers, and utility files. Umbrella headers are an invention of mine, as a collective component to combine similar modules into one shared/dynamic library.
Umbrella headers simplify the process of building shared libraries. Shared libraries are stored in the bin folder. Further explanations and usage instructions are provided in the mylibs folder's dedicated README.md.

A collection of libraries and utilities:
- **bin**: Precompiled shared libraries (`*.so`).
- **md4c**: Markdown processing library.
- **utility**: Helper utilities like `cManPage` and `cProgress`.
- Other libraries and makefiles.

### 5. **network**
Network utilities:
- `chkip`: A tool for IP-related tasks with source and makefile.

### 6. **tests**
Assorted test programs:
- Examples include `cAppend`, `cQuickSort`, `exmplNCurses`, and many more.
- Organized with individual source files and makefiles.

### 7. **tools**
Build and process management tools:
- Tools like `jmake` and `pmake` with corresponding source and makefiles.
