# mylibs
This folder contains shared libraries, umbrella headers, and utility files. Umbrella headers are an invention of mine, as a collective component to combine similar modules into one shared/dynamic library.
Umbrella headers simplify the process of building shared libraries. Shared libraries are stored in the bin folder.
